The scatterplot matrices are based on the technique of small multiples
cite:Tufte1990: small, thumbnail-sized representations of multiple
images displayed all at once, which allows the reader to immediately,
and in parallel, compare the inter-frame differences.  A scatterplot
matrix is a display of all pairwise bivariate scatterplots arranged in
a $p \times p$ matrix for $p$ variables. Each subplot shows the
relation between the pair of variables at the intersection of the row
and column indicated by the variable names in the diagonal panels
cite:Friendly.Denis2005.

This graphical tool is implemented in the =splom= function. The
following code displays the relation between the set of
meteorological variables using a sequential palette from the
ColorBrewer catalog (=RbBu=, with black added to complete a
twelve-color palette) to encode the month. The order of colors of
this palette is chosen in order to display summer months with
intense colors and to distinguish between the first and second
half of the year with red and blue, respectively (Figure
ref:fig:aranjuezSplom).

A bit of interactivity can be added to this plot with the
identification of some points. This task is easy with
=panel.link.splom=. The points are selected via mouse clicks (and
highlighted in green). Clicks other than left-clicks terminate the
procedure. The output of this function is the index of chosen
points.

Let's explore Figures ref:fig:aranjuezSplom and
ref:fig:aranjuezGGpairs. For example,
- The highest values of ambient temperature (average, maximum, and
  minimum), solar radiation, and evapotranspiration can be found
  during the summer.
- These variables are almost linearly related. The relation between
  radiation and temperature is different during both halves of the
  year (red and blue regions can be easily distinguished).
- The humidity reaches its highest values during winter without
  appreciable differences between the first and second half of the
  year. The temperature and humidity may be related with an
  exponential function.

** Hexagonal Binning label:SEC:hexbin

## Hexagonal binning
##################################################################
#+end_src

For large datasets, the display of a large number of points in a
scatterplot produces hidden point density, long computation times,
and slow displays. These problems can be circumvented with the
estimation and representation of points densities.  A common
encoding uses gray scales, pseudo colors or partial
transparency. An improved scheme encodes density as the size of
hexagon symbols inscribed within hexagonal binning regions
cite:Carr.Littlefield.ea1987.
#+INDEX: Packages!hexbin@\texttt{hexbin}
#+INDEX: Subjects!Hexagonal binning

The =hexbin= package cite:Carr.Lewin-Koh.ea2018 includes several
functions for hexagonal binning.  The =panel.hexbinplot= is a good
substitute for the default panel function. In addition, our first
attempt with =splom= can be improved with several modifications
(Figure ref:fig:aranjuezSplomHexbin):
- The panels of the lower part of the matrix (=lower.panel=) will
  include a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (loess) with
  =panel.loess= (line [[(lowerPanel)]]).
- The diagonal panels (=diag.panel=) will display the kernel density
  estimate of each variable (line [[(diagPanel)]]). The =density=
  function computes this estimate. The result is adjusted to the panel
  limits (calculated with =current.panel.limits=). The kernel density
  is plotted with =panel.lines= and the =diag.panel.splom= function
  completes the content of each diagonal panel.
- The scale's ticks and labels are suppressed with =pscale=0= (line
  [[(pscale)]])
- The point density is encoded with the default palette, =LinGray=,
  (darker colors for high density values and lighter colors for almost
  empty regions, with a gradient of grays for intermediate values).

A drawback of the matrix of scatterplots with hexagonal binning is
that each panel is drawn independently, so it is impossible to compute
a common color key for all of them. In other words, two cells with
exactly the same color in different panels encode different point
densities.

It is possible to display a reduced set of variables against another
one and generate a common color key using the =hexbinplot=
function. First, the dataset must be reshaped from the wide format
(one colum for each variable) to the long format (only one column for
the temperature values with one row for each observation). This task
is easily accomplished with the =melt= function included in the
=reshape2= package.

After discussing the hexagonal binning, let's recover the time
variable. Figure ref:fig:aranjuezSplom uses colors to encode
months. Instead, we will now display separate scatterplots with a
panel for each month. In addition, the statistic type (average,
maximum, minimum) is included as an additional conditioning variable.

This matrix of panels can be displayed with =ggplot= using
=facet_grid=. The code of Figure ref:fig:aranjuezFacetGrid uses partial
transparency to cope with overplotting, small horizontal and vertical
segments (=geom_rug=) to display points density on both variables, and
a smooth line in each panel.
